        % Guided by my passion for studying and technology, I approached the world of ICT in high school and delved into the subject until I graduated in Trento. Between my bachelor’s and master’s degrees, I worked in the field to understand what my passion really was. I am now in the final year of my master’s degree in autonomous systems and my main goal is to develop software for robots. Industrial robotics, control, and deep learning are the subjects I prefer and I am ready to apply them to my next challenge!
        Driven by my passion for learning and technology, I approached the ICT world during high school and delved into the subject until I graduated in Computer Science. Between my bachelor's and master's degrees, I worked in the field for a year to better understand which specialization was the most suitable for me.
        I have now completed my master's degree in Autonomous Systems, and I know that my primary goal is to develop software solutions for robots, as this will allow me to use the wide range of knowledge I've acquired throughout my education.
        Robotics, control, and deep learning are the subjects I prefer, and I am eager to apply them to my next challenge!

        I live in a tourist area and have always done \textbf{seasonal jobs}. Sometimes, I am far too meticulous, and indeed my scout \href{https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totem_(nome_scout)}{totem} is \textit{Precise Hedgehog}. I love sports, climbing and snowboarding in particular, even if my only addiction is \textbf{running}; I don't do it competitively, but I can't go more than 4 days without it!
