        Driven by my passion for learning and technology, I embraced the ICT world in high school and delved into the subject until I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science. After that, I worked in the field for one year and finally graduated in Autonomous Systems from a double degree program two years later. Since then, I have been working as a Software Engineer for robotics in Munich, where I contribute to simplifying the application of AI-driven solutions to industrial automation, particularly robotics.

         I live in a tourist area and have always done \textbf{seasonal jobs}. I do my best to complete what I commit to and, sometimes, I am even far too meticulous; this is why my scout \href{https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totem_(nome_scout)}{totem} is \textit{Precise Hedgehog}. I love sports, particularly climbing, running, and snowboarding: I don't do them competitively, but I am honestly addicted to them!
